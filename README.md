# NY_YellowTaxi_TripBehaviour_Analysis

The report here analysed the New York Yellow taxi trip behaviour. This trip behaviour was described using the trip frequency in each location, and the median trip distance travelled from each pickup location. The analysis was done during Winter, which is from December - February 2017-2019. The result shows that trip frequency would fall during Christmas and heavy snowfall rates. Average trip distance would also decrease when snow thickness reaches beyond five inches. The trip frequency and distance can be further described by adding another dimension, which is hour and day. Identifying this behavior may be important for the taxi drivers, as they may be able to estimate during a specific day and hour, which area may have the most demand for a taxi ride.

## Dataset
